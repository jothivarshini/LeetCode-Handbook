# LeetCode-Handbook


**What's this repository for?**

So I decided it was high time that I work out some coding problems. And since I heard that LeetCode is one of the best places to get in those "interview kind" of problems, I thought it was best for me to actually solve them for my knowledge. 

**The languages that I'll be using:**

I prefer to code in Python (and a bit of Java), so the solutions would be in one of the two languages. I might sprinkle some C/C++ if I'm feeling up to it (:

The questions for the problems would be commented in the files.
